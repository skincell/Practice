Initial feedback on myself right after the video:
I spent good portion of the time not realizing that something was occuring on the screen, but I just couldn't see it because it was too small
I thought that I misunderstood how Rect worked, but it was more like that I didn't see the output.
I changed the background to white to get better feedback this helped.
Spent my time wasting on it at that point trying to get other objects on screen.


Should go through and figure out how much time was spent researching, aimlessly moving my cursor about, how long it took me to get a screen up and running, how long for a background, how long for objects on the screen etc.
Event timeline:
1st window on screen around the 10 minute mark. Futzed with window size for about 1.5 minutes

Game loop and quit function done around the 16 minute mark
Trying to get changes/fill to show up on game from 16 minute to 20:40 mark -> had problem with the flip command
From the 20:40 mark till 21 minute mark tried to make the background color more appetizing
From the 21 minute mark onward to 33:48 tried to get a rect to appear on screen
From 33:48 to 39:48 try to figure out the position of the rects and where to put them
39:48 to 44:39 try to add in the walls of the pong game
Quit after this time because no time left.

Research time: majority is this
Coding time: not very much of this
