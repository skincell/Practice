This session's objective is to identify what causes me to slow down in programming and not meet all of my goals in a 90 minute prototyping session.

Success for the Project: get a basic pong working with collision dynamics
Succes for me: make notes on what I spent my time doing -> coding, planning, etc.

May the best win (me against the project)

Time limit: 45 minuts
