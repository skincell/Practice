Objectives:
To reduce the amount of time used to do new things
To go through and give myself feedback - timings and hopefully on the other stuff

Would be good but I don't have great evaluation critera.
To make the code cleaner than the previous version of the code (This is a vague goal. I don't have anything to evaluate this with.)
   - I feel like this should not be clean, but code that is easy for other programmers to use and get into -> however this code will not be complicated enough for that to be apparent?
   - Have this code and other pieces of code to ask other programmers to add a feature and record when they add the feature how they interact with the code?
   - Having a random programmer add to this code would also give me an idea about the code and the programmer's style.
