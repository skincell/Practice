Initial feedback on myself right after the video:
2 minute mark had screen up
8 minute mark had event queue up
19 minute mark had the first object coded in.... -> what happened here -idk.
23 minute mark had it on screen
26 minute mark had everything else on screen
32 minute mark had movement occuring
37 minute mark had continous movement occuring
41 minute mark had non-crazy movement occuring
42.5 mark had second player moving
47:30 mark had collision


Bugs:
can't move two paddles at once -> input bug can't take in multiple inputs at once -> it is because of the delay hack.

Hacks:
Delay hack for movement cases

Time: 45 minutes -> went over at 47:40ish
