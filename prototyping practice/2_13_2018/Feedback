Alright Timings:
first window 3:30 with event queue
Have everything set up 15:42
movement for paddles: 24:10
collision at 30:00
Circle appears at 35:00
Circles moving 39:00
Rects colliding 48:00
Rects bouncing 49:30





Ideas for game modes:
Game modes have a center ball send off pong balls for both players to fend off
Have a little ball inside the pong paddle move the paddle across the screen
Have the one who sent out the ball have control of the walls instead of their paddle after they send it off
Could have a king of the hill version where the one with the points sends out the balls and has x amount of time to have everybody lose.


Hurrahs:
Fixed the double movement issue -> have a counter which controls this.


Things to think about:
better collision detection
a guarenteed fps counter how are these implemented...
I am repeating using the collision detection for each set of movement options, counter/speed control for each set, etc.
